									Staffsverse was a project led by Staffordshire University students where we were briefed to create a metaverse-like application to introduce new students to the university's campus. 
									The project had 3 teams: The art team, design team and tech team. The result was a 1:1 scale experience of the uni on Mars. The idea of being on mars was briefed to us by our head of the Games department. 
									
									This project will be an ongoing project that will take a few years to develop, but ~25 students were responsible for creating the foundations.

																<p style="margin:0;">I programmed in C++ and blueprints to help with some features and mechanics within Staffsverse.</p>
																<p style="margin:0;">One of these features I created was a waypoint system that would help navigate users around the map.</p>
																<p style="margin:0;">I would also collaborate with other programmers on the team to create systems too. One of these systems</p>
																<p style="margin:0;">I helped to develop was a quest system. When creating these systems, we had to ensure each system was designer friendly and easier to use. We also had to make a technical document which explained to other</p>
																<p style="margin:0;">programmers how our system worked on a technical aspect, and we had to create a technical design document to help inform designers on how to use our systems within the editor.</p>

																<p style="margin:0;">I would go around our tech team and perform "code reviews", where I would</p>

															<td style = "text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">Github manager</td>

																<p>In this project, we could only use GitHub as source control. My role as manager was to make sure developers would know how to use GitHub and follow a standard that I helped to create. I was also responsible for reviewing pull requests, and I was one of the few people allowed to merge branches into the main branch.</p>

															<td style = "text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">Optimising</td>
															<td>
																<p>Towards the end of the project, I would go through the project and increase our frame rate. I would use Unreal’s profiling tools and RenderDoc to highlight potential performance bottlenecks within our project. We couldn’t use all of Unreal’s features because our project also needs to target lower-end machines. I planned and told the design team how to reduce draw calls and ensured the project had a few overdraw issues—both of which were the main bottlenecks of our project.</p>

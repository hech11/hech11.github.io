									<p>Amaurosis was a university project where we simulated a small team of programmers to create this game. I was the main programming lead and oversaw development of nearly all systems. I was also responsible for shader work and architecturing the game.</p>
									<p>Amaurosis is a first-person horror survival game where the player you must complete objectives while evading a monster that is roaming around and hunting you. Both player and monster are blind.
									<p>For the player to see their surroundings they must make noise to emit noise waves around them. The player can make noise by walking and throwing objects. However while noise waves are used to help the player see they are also used by the monster to help locate the player. To win players must complete mini games and turn on generators to power the door to escape.</p></p>

															<p style="margin:0;">One of my responsibilities as the lead programmer was to oversee the entire development lifecycle, including initial planning, technical requirements of the game and then the final build of the game. I had to create project plans, allocate resources effectively and set realistic milestones and deadlines.</p>
															<br>
															<p style="margin: 0;">I would communicate everyday with my team members to ensure progress was being made and make sure they can achieve the task. I would encourage agile methodologies to the team by continuously iterating on the development process. I had to make sure that the code was written cleanly and was maintainable while ahearing to the standards we agreed on.</p>
														</td>

													<tr>
														<td style = "text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">Optimisation</td>
														<td>
															<p style="margin:0;">Towards the end of the project, I would go through the project and increase our frame rate. I would use Unity's profiling tools and RenderDoc to highlight potential performance bottlenecks within our project. The main bottlenecks was shader performance, so I had to rewrite my shaders to be more performant, this includes data packing rules and render ordering. I also made sure that the main unity scene was optimised too.</p>

														<td style = "text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">Github manager</td>
														<td>
															<p style="margin:0;">This project used Github as our main source control. My role was to make sure developers were on correct branches and make sure that there would be no merge conflicts. This mean't that I was responsible for reviewing pull requests, and I was one of the few people allowed to merge branches into the main branch.</p>

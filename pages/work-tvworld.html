									<p>TV-World was a college project where we had to simulate a small studio team. This game was the first project I worked on, where I managed and programmed a game to completion within a team over a substantial amount of time. We had 7 months to create any game we'd like as long as it fits a specific aesthetic, and we had a central game mechanic. In this game's case, the main mechanic was "Upgrading yourself", and the aesthetics were the 80s.</p>

															<th>Responsibilities</th>
														</tr>
													</thead>
													<tbody>
														<tr>
															<td style = "text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">Main and only programmer</td>
															<td>
																<p style="margin:0;">I had to program everything from shaders to AI to state machines and tools to create the game. As part of the assignment, we could not use any pre-existing assets, including code, so everything had to be made from scratch. The exception was that we could use free tools to help make the game. In this case, I decided to use Unity.</p>
																<br>
																<p style="margin:0;">Since I was the only programmer on the project, I had to design and create scripts and tools for designers. Everything from a player controller to how we manage cutscenes and dialogue trees had to be made in a designer-friendly way. I took advantage of Unity's custom editors to help designers create the content within the game.</p>
															</td>
														</tr>
														<tr>
															<td style = "text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">Games designer</td>
															<td>
																<p style="margin:0;">We all agreed to contribute to the game's design as a team. TV-World is a platformer and a collectathon, so we would look at other games of the same genre to see what made those games fun. I was also tasked to create a game's design document that would contain the "essence" of the game and break down mechanics on how they worked. </p>
															</td>
														</tr>
														<tr>
															<td style = "text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">Producer</td>
															<td>
																<p style="margin:0;">We used tools such as HacknPlan to help assign and manage tasks that needed to be done. I would talk to my peers and hold meetings to ensure that we were on schedule and could overcome a problem. This was important as this game was being developed during the COVID pandemic, where we had to work from home. If any issues occurred, I had to make sure we had a plan to overcome them.</p>
															</td>
														</tr>
														<tr>
															<td style = "text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">Github manager</td>
															<td>
																<p style="margin:0;">In this project, we used GitHub as source control. My role as manager was to ensure developers would know how to use GitHub and follow a standard I created.</p>
